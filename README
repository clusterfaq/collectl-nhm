This is nhm's custom collectl fork with experimental modifications to improve
playback speed for processing data from large HPC clusters with many nodes.
There are quite possibly bugs in this fork that do not exist in the mainstream
collectl.  Only use if you are brave and/or willing to test.  If it breaks
you get to keep both peices!

If you're real lazy, just run INSTALL and it will install collectl into the
same locations as the rpm.  It will install as /usr/bin/collectl and all the
other runtime components will be placed into /usr/share/collectl.  If you
really care where everything goes, read the script as it's pretty short.
There's also an UNINSTALL that will completely remove everything.

If you want to be more creative, you can either hack up the installation
script or use it as a guide to move things around to whereever you want them
keeping a couple of things in mind:
- collectl.conf is looked for first in /etc and then in its binary directory
- all ph files must be in the same directory as collectl itself OR /usr/share/collectl
